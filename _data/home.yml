    desc: >
      The performance of the ROS Gmapping SLAM package under varying levels
      of simulated Lidar noise is analyzed. By introducing different
      noise profiles, the impact on map accuracy and localization is evaluated,
      providing insights into the robustness of Gmapping in real-world
      scenarios with sensor imperfections.
